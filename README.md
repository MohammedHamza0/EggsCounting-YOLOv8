# ðŸ¥š Egg Counting with YOLOv8 and OpenCV

This project demonstrates a system for automatically counting eggs in a video using the YOLOv8 object detection model and OpenCV for video processing. The system tracks eggs in real-time as they move through a defined area in the video frame.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Real-Time Object Detection**: Utilizes the YOLOv8 model to accurately detect and track eggs in a video stream.
- **Custom Line Counting**: Implements a virtual line that counts eggs as they pass through a specific area in the frame.
- **Dynamic Visualization**: Displays the counting process on the video in real-time, updating the count as the video progresses.
